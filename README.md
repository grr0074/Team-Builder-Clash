Dependencies - 

The web app is built within react, fellow team members looking to recreate the code // enviorment their are two options. 

You can create your own personal enviornent for testing with the following commands : 

npm install create-react-app
npx create-react-app test-app(name can be anything)
npm install 
cd test-app
npm start

You can also simply clone the git hub, editing the files from there and comitting the changes. Would recommend using the git hub desktop if you go down this route. 

To fully get a testing enviorment I would follow the first solution, copy and pasting the exisiting git hub code into the according files // creating the necessary files in the src directory.

npm install axios
